MicroGridsPy Environment
================================

This branch contains environment files for setting up MicroGridsPy across different versions and platforms. Use these files to configure your environment on Windows or macOS using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html).

## Quick Start

* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you haven't already.

* Download the environment YAML file for your desired version and place it in “C:/Users/youruser”

* Create and activate the mgpy environment by running the following command in the Anaconda Prompt terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   conda env create -f mgpy_win.yml
   conda activate mgpy
